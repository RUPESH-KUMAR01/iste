            <p className="text-base text-muted border-l-4 border-primary pl-4">Since 2017, at Social Initiatives ISTE NITK, our motive has been to nurture a socially inclusive environment in which students of NITK develop a healthy open-minded attitude and awareness towards various social issues, like inequality, indiscrimination, mental health issues etc., and thereby inculcate a cooperative and caring nature towards everyone else.
      To bring about these, we regularly organize events and workshops related to social awareness in NITK and have received a positive response from the students. Some of the activities are open mic events, group discussions on social topics and interviews with people to share their views and opinions on a particular topic. We aim to continue organizing such events and make a positive contribution to society.</p>
